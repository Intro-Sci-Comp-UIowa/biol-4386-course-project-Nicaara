### Using ARGON to align ITS sequences using MAFFT and create a RAxML maximum likelihood tree

##### Intro 
*Stereum* is a globally widespread genus of basidiomycete fungi with conspicuous shelf-like fruiting bodies. Several species have been extensively studied as pathogens and for medically relevant secondary metabolites, but prior to this publication the molecular phylogeny of *Stereum* had not been analyzed, despite pervasive morphological crypsis in the genus. Here, we provide a preliminary investigation into species boundaries among some North American Stereum. The nominal species *Stereum ostrea* has been referenced in field guides, textbooks, and scientific papers as a common fungus with a wide geographic range and even wider morphological variability. We use nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) sequence data of specimens from midwestern and eastern North America, alongside morphological and ecological characters, to show that Stereum ostrea is a complex of at least three reproductively isolated species. Preliminary morphological analyses show that these three species correspond to three historical taxa that were previously synonymized with or confused for *S. ostrea*: *Stereum fasciatum*, *Stereum lobatum*, and *Stereum subtomentosum*. *Stereum hirsutum* ITS sequences taken from GenBank suggest that other *Stereum* species may also be species complexes. Future work should apply a multilocus approach and global sampling strategy to better resolve the taxonomy and evolutionary history of this important fungal genus.
